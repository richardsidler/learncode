# LearnCode GUI Project

### About This Project
Hello! I am a **programming beginner** using this repository to learn the ropes of software development. 

The primary goal of this project isn't just the code itself, but learning how to:
* Configure a professional **working environment** on my ThinkPad T440s.
* Manage Python libraries using **Virtual Environments (`.venv`)**.
* Use **Git and GitHub** to track my progress and maintain a "mirror" of my work.

### What's Inside?
* `gui_window.py`: My main Tkinter interface experiment.
* `your_gui_window.py`: A comparison file used to test interactive logic.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Library:** Tkinter (for the Graphical User Interface)
* **OS:** Ubuntu Linux
* **IDE:** VS Code

*“Every expert was once a beginner.”*
